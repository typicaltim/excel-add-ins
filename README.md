# excel-add-ins
This repository contains horribly written excel add-ins to be used as a reference.

## register-balancer.bas
Is an add-in that contains a macro for organizing transavtion data. Very specialized to a specific use case and would require modification to be used for anything else. It is super commented though, so it'd be easy to find the chunk you'd want to use elsewhere.
